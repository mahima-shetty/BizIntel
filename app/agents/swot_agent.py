You're a senior business analyst preparing a detailed SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis.

Here is a summary of the company's business and strategy:

{summary}

Sector: {sector}
Industry: {industry}

Based on this data and your domain knowledge, provide a thorough SWOT analysis:

1. **Strengths** – What internal capabilities, assets, or market advantages does the company have?
2. **Weaknesses** – What are its internal challenges or gaps compared to competitors?
3. **Opportunities** – What trends, technologies, or new markets can the company leverage?
4. **Threats** – What external risks (macro, regulatory, competitive, etc.) could undermine its performance?

Include competitor risks, market shifts, and regulatory threats where relevant.

Format: 
- Use clear section headers (e.g., **Strengths**) 
- Provide 3–5 bullet points per section
- Be specific. Avoid generic corporate language.
- Target a professional reader in tech or finance.
